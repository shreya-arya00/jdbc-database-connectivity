# Difference between Statement and PreparedStatement

When working with Java and databases, understanding the difference between Statement and PreparedStatement is crucial. Both are interfaces provided by JDBC (Java Database Connectivity), but they serve different purposes and have distinct advantages and disadvantages.

## Statement

- **Basic Usage**: Statement is the simplest interface used to execute SQL queries against a database.
- **SQL Injection Vulnerability**: Statements are prone to SQL injection attacks because they directly concatenate user inputs into the SQL query string.
- **Compilation**: Each time a query is executed, the database compiles it, leading to potential overhead, especially for complex queries.
- **Performance**: Due to lack of precompilation, Statements might be slower when executing multiple similar queries in a loop.
- **Reusability**: Statements are not reusable. If you want to execute the same query with different parameters, you need to create a new Statement object each time.

## PreparedStatement

- **Parameterized Queries**: PreparedStatement allows parameterized queries, where placeholders are used for dynamic values. This helps prevent SQL injection attacks as input values are treated as parameters rather than concatenated directly into the query string.
- **Precompilation**: PreparedStatement compiles the SQL query once during creation, leading to better performance, especially for repeated executions.
- **Security**: By using parameterized queries, PreparedStatement provides better security against SQL injection attacks.
- **Performance**: Due to precompilation, PreparedStatement can be faster than Statement, especially when executing the same query multiple times with different parameters.
- **Reusability**: PreparedStatement objects are reusable. Once created, you can set new parameter values and execute the query multiple times without recompilation.

## Conclusion

PreparedStatement is generally preferred over Statement due to its performance benefits, better security features, and reusability. It is recommended to use PreparedStatement for executing dynamic SQL queries, especially when dealing with user inputs or executing queries in a loop. However, Statement might still be suitable for simple, static queries where performance and security concerns are minimal.
